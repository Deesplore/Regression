Problem Statement:  

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time.
Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes..


Insights and Recommendations for Rental Bike System in Urban Cities  

Context and Importance 

Rental bikes in urban cities enhance mobility comfort, emphasizing the need for their timely availability to minimize waiting times. The prediction of bike count required at each hour plays a crucial role in ensuring a stable supply for public use.

Seoul's Bike Demand Observations 

Rainfall Impact: Bike rentals peak at low rainfall (1.3mm: 764 counts) compared to no rainfall (739 counts). Moderate rainfall (12mm to 16mm) sees reduced counts. 

Temperature Influence: Normal temperatures (32째C) witness the highest bike rentals (1692), while extreme temperatures (-15째C) yield the lowest (25). 

Seasonal Variations: Summer records the highest rentals (1034), followed by moderate rentals in Spring and Autumn (730 to 8194). Winter experiences the least demand (225).  

Day Types and Times: Non-holidays observe higher bike rentals (715), contrasting with holiday counts (499). Evening peak (6 pm) witnesses the most rentals (1502), emphasizing availability adjustments for different times. 

Weekly and Monthly Trends: Saturdays see higher rentals (719), while Sundays record lower counts (667). The highest monthly count peaks in June (1245) with a notable drop in December (249). 

Recommendations for Bike Availability  

Optimizing Weather Conditions: Ensure higher bike availability during low rainfall and within the temperature range of 15째C to 32째C, which garners the most demand. 

Seasonal Adjustments: Prioritize bike availability in summer, followed by Spring and Autumn. Adjustments in supply should align with seasonal preferences. 

Day and Time Optimization: Maintain consistent availability throughout the week but ensure higher counts on non-functional days. Focus on evenings and peak hours for increased bike availability. 

Monthly Planning: Scale up bike supply in June and adjust according to monthly demand trends, considering lower counts in December. 

Machine Learning Insights 

Best Performing Model: LightGBM, after grid search optimization, emerged as the most accurate model and highlighted 'hour' as the most critical feature.  

Utilizing Hourly Insights: Increase bike availability during peak hours, especially in the evening, aligning with office timings and heightened demand periods. 
 
Impact and Potential Extensions  


Real-World Application: This project showcased machine learning's practical use in understanding bike demand patterns, aiding in supply management. 



Applicability to Other Cities: Findings and strategies derived here can potentially benefit cities with similar bike sharing systems by adapting to their specific demand patterns.
